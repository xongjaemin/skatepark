                The street skateboarding competitions will be held on 26 and 27 July 2020, 
                and the park skateboarding competitions will be held on 5 and 6 August 2020.

                The park competition comprises two rounds: prelims and finals.
                In the prelims, 20 skaters will first compete in four heats of five skaters. <br>
                The first eight skaters from the combined ranking of the heats will progress to the finals.<br>
                <br>
                In each round, the skater’s best of three 45-second runs count as their final round score. <br>
                Five judges use a 0-100.00 point scale. The highest and lowest scores for each run are dropped, <br>
                and the remaining three scores are averaged to two decimal places resulting in the final run score.
